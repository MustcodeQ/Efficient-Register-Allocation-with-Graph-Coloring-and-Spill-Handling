# Efficient Register Allocation with Graph Coloring and Spill Handling

This project focuses on efficient register allocation using graph coloring and spill handling techniques. Register allocation is a crucial part of the compiler optimization process, aiming to minimize the number of registers used during code execution. This solution employs graph coloring to assign variables to registers, with spill handling strategies to ensure performance when there aren't enough registers available.

## Overview
Register allocation plays a critical role in optimizing the performance of compiled programs. The project uses graph coloring and spill handling to achieve efficient register allocation, reducing the use of memory and improving the execution of generated code. This approach is widely applicable in compilers and low-level code optimization.

## Features
- Graph coloring to assign variables to registers.
- Spill handling to minimize memory usage when registers are insufficient.
- Optimized performance through strategic register management.
- Applicable in any system requiring efficient register allocation.

Algorithm Explanation
This project employs a graph-based approach for register allocation:

Each variable is represented as a node in a graph.
An edge is created between two nodes if their corresponding variables are in conflict and must be placed in different registers.
Graph coloring algorithms are used to assign colors (registers) to nodes, ensuring that conflicting nodes receive different colors.
Spill handling techniques are used when there are more variables than available registers, where the excess variables are spilled to memory.
