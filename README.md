Efficient Register Allocation with Graph Coloring and Spill Handling
This project focuses on efficient register allocation using graph coloring and spill handling techniques. Register allocation is a crucial part of the compiler optimization process, aiming to minimize the number of registers used during code execution. This solution employs graph coloring to assign variables to registers, along with spill handling strategies to ensure optimal performance when there aren't enough registers available.

Overview
Register allocation plays a critical role in optimizing the performance of compiled programs. This project utilizes graph coloring and spill handling to achieve efficient register allocation, reducing memory usage and improving the execution of generated code. This approach is widely applicable in compilers and low-level code optimization.

Features
Graph Coloring: Efficiently assigns variables to registers.
Spill Handling: Minimizes memory usage when registers are insufficient.
Optimized Performance: Enhances execution through strategic register management.
Broad Applicability: Useful in any system requiring efficient register allocation.

Algorithm Explanation
This project employs a graph-based approach for register allocation:

Each variable is represented as a node in a graph.
An edge is created between two nodes if their corresponding variables are in conflict and must be placed in different registers.
Graph coloring algorithms are utilized to assign colors (registers) to nodes, ensuring that conflicting nodes receive different colors.
Spill handling techniques are employed when there are more variables than available registers, spilling excess variables to memory.
